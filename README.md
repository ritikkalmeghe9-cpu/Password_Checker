# Password_Checker
A Password Checker verifies the strength and safety of user-chosen passwords. It scores passwords (weak → strong), explains weaknesses, and suggests fixes. This project teaches password-strength metrics, string processing, hashing, and optional API integration for breach checks — useful for portfolios, coursework, or as a security.
